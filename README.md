# Program Description

## Overview
This program [InvertedIndex.py](InvertedIndex.py) reads the Urdu Corpus Files and creates two files: an index file (term list) and a postings file. The index file contains a sorted list of terms from the document collection (Urdu Corpus), excluding stop words. The index data is stored in the form of a linked list, with consideration for adding new terms. Each term in the index contains its document frequency, and there is a unique ID associated with each term that links to the list of postings for that term. The postings file contains a list of postings for each term in the term list, sorted by documents and location within the document. Additionally, the postings file includes positional indexing, indicating the positions of the term where it occurs in the document.
